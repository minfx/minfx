Version 1.0.3
(27 August 2011, from /trunk)
http://svn.gna.org/svn/minfx/tags/1.0.3

    Features:
        * Addition of the scipy anneal.py module for an initial and temporary implementation of simulated annealing.
        * The grid search accepts an arbitrary list of points to allow a completely non-linear search.
        * Addition of a minfx specific error system.

    Changes:
        * Added support for constraints into grid_split(), points which violate the constraints are now eliminated prior to the grid subdivision.
        * Added the grid_split() generator function.  This takes a linear grid, converts it to a linear array of points, and then splits these returning each grid subdivision.
        * The optimisation output is more consistent, the numpy array has been even better formatted.
        * Modified the grid search to return a warning and to handle models with zero parameters.
        * The output of generic_minimise() has been cleaned up - the numpy parameter is printed as a list.
        * The optimisation output has been prettified - the numpy array has been better formatted.
        * Modified the grid search print out to be prettier.
        * Redesigned the grid search function.  The grid_ops arg has been replaced by the more intuitive num_incs, lower and upper args from the number of increments, lower bound, and upper bound value lists respectively.  The new incs argument has been added to allow custom non-linear grid searches.  The new MinfxError system is now being used, and many arguments are being checked.  The docstring has been converted to epydoc format.
        * A MinfxError is now raised if the supplied minimisation algorithm cannot be identified.
        * Removed the grid search option from the generic_minimise() function.  The minimisation options are too messy and inflexible.  The grid search should be preformed by direct calls to grid.grid().
        * Modified the grid search print out to indicated the number of grid points used.

    Bugfixes:
        * Print out fix for the grid search when the verbosity level was set great than 2.
        * Fix for grid_split() for when the number of divisions is more than the total number of points.
        * Bug fix for the catching of models with zero parameters.



Version 1.0.2
(30 August 2009, from /trunk)
http://svn.gna.org/svn/minfx/tags/1.0.2

    Features:
        * Added support for Python 2.6 - the variable 'as' can no longer be used as it is now a Python statement!

    Changes:
        * N/A

    Bugfixes:
        * Fixed a rare bug in the backtracking line search sub-algorithm affecting very distorted spaces (see bug #12501).


Version 1.0.1
(28 September 2008, from /trunk)
http://svn.gna.org/svn/minfx/tags/1.0.1

    Features:
        * Full conversion from Numeric python to numpy.
        * Improved testing for the Hessian being positive definite in the Cholesky Hessian modification.
        * Models of zero size can now be handled.
        * More graceful failure for when the gradient is not supplied when needed.

    Changes:
        * Switch from GPLv2 to GPLv3.

    Bugfixes:
        * Module name clash in the Cholesky Hessian modification.
