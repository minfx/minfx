* Tag the master branch with:

$ git tag 1.0.13

In the commit message, the header line should say 'Minfx version 1.0.13.', followed by a short description of the release.



* Review the git logs and add an entry into the CHANGES file for the current release.  Create three sections titled 'Features', 'Changes', and 'Bugfixes'.  Commit the changes and then port the revision back into the main line.



* Change the version number in both 'minfx.toml' and 'minfx.__init__.__version__', and commit and push the changes.



* Generate the distribution files by typing:

$ python -m build

and generate their GPG signatures by going into the dist/ directory and typing:

$ gpg --detach-sign --default-key xxx minfx-1.0.13-py3-none-any.whl
$ gpg --detach-sign --default-key xxx minfx-1.0.13.tar.gz

where xxx is the name of your private GPG key.


* Move the distribution files and their signatures to the mirror directory for the minfx download site.  This directory should contain all the files and directories accessible from 'https://sourceforge.net/projects/minfx/files/'.  First make sure the mirror directory contains all of the files so that the next command does not accidentally delete files:

$ rsync -av --progress --no-perms -e ssh edauvergne@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/minfx/ .

Then rsync the entire directory contents using the command:

$ rsync --delete -avP --copy-links --progress --partial --no-perms -e ssh --numeric-ids . edauvergne@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/minfx/


* Create the API documentation for the current version with the command:

$ ./doc/api.sh

Replace the old API documentation in the git repository (https://sourceforge.net/p/minfx/website/ci/master/tree/), commit the new files, and push the changes.



* Post the release message to the minfx-announce mailing list.

On the minfx-announce mailing list, write a detailed and full description of the release.  Also add a paragraph with links for downloading the release.  At the end, add a section titled 'The full list of changes is:' and copy and paste the part of the CHANGES file for this release.  Include links to the trackers in the full list of changes.


* Update the version number in the FSF directory (http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Minfx).
