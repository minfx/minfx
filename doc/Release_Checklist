* Make a copy of the current head to the tags directory using a command such as:

$ svn cp -F svn_msg svn+ssh://bugman@svn.gna.org/svn/minfx/trunk svn+ssh://bugman@svn.gna.org/svn/minfx/tags/1.0.1

In the commit message file 'svn_msg', have a header line which says 'minfx version 1.0.1.', followed by a short description of the release.



* Checkout the tagged version with:

$ svn co svn+ssh://bugman@svn.gna.org/svn/minfx/tags/1.0.1



* Review the SVN logs and add an entry into the CHANGES file (in the 'docs/' directory) for the current release.  Create three sections titled 'Features', 'Changes', and 'Bugfixes'.  Commit the changes and then port the revision back into the main line.



* Change the version number in both 'setup.py' and 'minfx.__init__.__version__', and commit the changes.



* Generate the distribution files by typing:

$ python setup.py sdist --formats=bztar,gztar,zip

and generate their GPG signatures by going into the dist/ directory and typing:

$ gpg --detach-sign --default-key xxx minfx-1.0.1.tar.bz2
$ gpg --detach-sign --default-key xxx minfx-1.0.1.tar.gz
$ gpg --detach-sign --default-key xxx minfx-1.0.1.zip

where xxx is the name of your private GPG key.


* Move the distribution files and their signatures, as well as the PDF manual, to the mirror directory for the minfx download site.  This directory should contain all the files and directories accessible from 'http://download.gna.org/minfx/'.  Rsync the entire directory contents to download.gna.org/upload/minfx/ using the command

$ rsync --delete -av --no-perms --rsh="ssh" . bugman@download.gna.org:/upload/minfx/



* Add the version number to the bug tracker field 'Release' at https://gna.org/bugs/admin/field_values.php?group=minfx.



* Post the release message to the minfx-announce mailing list, as a news item on the minfx Gna! website, and on the freshmeat website.

On the minfx-announce mailing list, write a detailed and full description of the release.  Also add a paragraph with links for downloading the release.  At the end, add a section titled 'The full list of changes is:' and cut and paste the part of the CHANGES file for this release.  Include links to the trackers in the full list of changes.

For the news item, firstly cut and paste the mailing list message.  Create three sections using the Savane markup (recipe #236).  Call these = Description =, = Download =, and = Full list of changes =.  For the last section, use the subtitles == Features == ,  == Changes == , and  == Bugfixes ==.  The items in this section start with '* ' to create an unnumbered list.  Strip all leading whitespace from the full list of changes and remove all the links to the trackers (as these will be automatically created).

For freshmeat (http://freshmeat.net), go to the minfx project page at http://freshmeat.net/projects/minfx.  Click on 'All releases' in the 'Recent releases' section, then on 'Submit new release'.  If this is the first release of a new minor number 'x.x.0', a branch will need to be created first by clicking on 'add branch'.  Add the version number, a brief and concise summary of the release, select the release focus category, and update the Tar/BZ2 and Zip URLs.
