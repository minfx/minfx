###############################################################################


Temporary branch
================

Firstly create and switch to a local, and temporary, git branch using commands such as:

$ git branch 1.0.13 master
$ git checkout 1.0.13

This will create a new branch explicitly from the master branch.  A number of changes will be committed to this branch prior to tagging and deletion of the temporary branch.


Version number
==============

Change the version number in both 'minfx.toml' and 'minfx.__init__.__version__', and commit and push the changes.


CHANGES file
============

Review the git logs and add an entry into the CHANGES file for the current release.  Create three sections titled 'Features', 'Changes', and 'Bugfixes'.  Commit the changes and then cherry-pick the commit back into the master branch:

$ git checkout master
$ git cherry-pick [hash]


Tagging
=======

Tag the release, remove the temporary branch, and push the tag to the remote repositories with:

$ git checkout 1.0.13
$ git tag -m "minfx version 1.0.13." 1.0.13
$ git checkout master
$ git branch -D 1.0.13
$ git push --tags

If all the minfx mirrors are configured as remotes with the 'pushremotes' alias, instead type:

$ git pushremotes --tags


Distribution files
==================

Generate the distribution files by typing:

$ python -m build

Generate their GPG signatures by going into the dist/ directory and typing:

$ gpg --detach-sign --default-key xxx minfx-1.0.13-py3-none-any.whl
$ gpg --detach-sign --default-key xxx minfx-1.0.13.tar.gz

where xxx is the name of your private GPG key.


Upload
======

Move the distribution files and their signatures to the mirror directory for the minfx download site.  This directory should contain all the files and directories accessible from 'https://sourceforge.net/projects/minfx/files/'.  First make sure the mirror directory contains all of the files so that the next command does not accidentally delete files:

$ rsync -av --progress --no-perms -e ssh edauvergne@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/minfx/ .

Then rsync the entire directory contents using the command:

$ rsync --delete -avP --copy-links --progress --partial --no-perms -e ssh --numeric-ids . edauvergne@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/minfx/


Website
=======

Create the API documentation for the current version with the command:

$ ./doc/api.sh

Replace the old API documentation in the git repository (https://sourceforge.net/p/minfx/website/ci/master/tree/), commit the new files, and push the changes.


FSF directory
=============

Update the version number in the FSF directory (http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Minfx).


Announcement
============

Post the release message to the minfx-announce mailing list.  Write a detailed and full description of the release.  Also add a paragraph with links for downloading the release.  At the end, add a section titled 'The full list of changes is:' and copy and paste the part of the CHANGES file for this release.  Include links to the trackers in the full list of changes.
